<h1>Universal Harness Continuity & Crimp Test System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Designed and implemented a universal electrical harness testing system to validate
continuity and crimp integrity across full product harness lineup.
The system significantly improved test coverage, repeatability, and manufacturing efficiency.
</p>

<h2>System Description</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Arduino Mega as primary controller</li>
    <li>Integrated LCD display for technician interaction</li>
    <li>Dual-sided chassis architecture</li>
    <li>Support for all Molex and JST connectors used across products</li>
    <li>Support for Deutsch connectors ranging from 4-pole to 8-pole</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Designed scalable harness test architecture covering all connector variants</li>
    <li>Implemented automated continuity and crimp validation logic</li>
    <li>Developed LCD-driven UI for guided test workflows</li>
    <li>Reduced operator error through standardized test procedures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
Improved harness validation reliability while reducing manual inspection time and
operator dependency during production testing.
