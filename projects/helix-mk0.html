<h1>Helix Mk. 1 – Autonomous Mobile Robot</h1>

<img class="hero" src="../Assets/projects/helix-mk0/hero.png" alt="Helix Mk. 0 robot">

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Helix Mk. 0 was an early autonomous mobile robot prototype focused on robotic mechanical design.
It became a passion project for me to create my own ROS-enabled robot (leading to the current model: Helix Mk. 1), 
starting me on a journey since Winter of 2023 while working at Clearpath Robotics as a Robot Builder.
