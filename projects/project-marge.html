    <!-- ================= Overview ================= -->
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Project MARGE was developed as part of the First-Year Mechatronics Engineering
        Cornerstone Project. The robot was designed to autonomously clean desk and ground
        surfaces using integrated mopping and air-blowing mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite being constrained to unreliable, low-cost sensors provided for the project,
        MARGE demonstrated robust autonomous behavior and repeatability, achieving less than
        10% operational error. The project was one of the few to receive a perfect score during
        demo day evaluations.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= System Architecture ================= -->
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>LEGO EV3 intelligent brick as the primary controller</li>
        <li>LEGO EV3 motors and sensors</li>
        <li>Color sensors for desk-edge detection and guidance</li>
        <li>Mopping and air-blowing cleaning mechanisms</li>
        <li>Tetrix aluminum extrusions and couplings for mechanical structure</li>
        <li>Embedded control implemented using RobotC</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ================= Autonomy Pipeline ================= -->
    <h2>Autonomous Operation Pipeline</h2>

    <h3>1. Mapping Mode</h3>
    <p>
        After being placed in one of the four corners of a desk, MARGE enters a mapping
        sequence where it follows the desk perimeter using color sensor-based edge detection.
        Encoder values are recorded to estimate desk dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
        A robust guidance strategy ensured MARGE maintained alignment with the desk edges
        throughout the mapping process.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Offsetting & Coverage Planning</h3>
    <p>
        Using the mapped dimensions, MARGE calculates an optimal cleaning trajectory by
        subdividing the desk into a series of equally spaced rectangular passes. During
        this stage, the mopping mechanism is deployed and activated.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Localization & Homing</h3>
    <p>
        After completing the primary cleaning passes, MARGE enters a remainder stage to
        address any unvisited regions. The robot then determines its location relative
        to the start of the mission and autonomously returns to its deployment position.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Project MARGE provided early exposure to real-world robotics challenges such as
        unreliable sensing, imperfect actuation, and the importance of robust autonomous
        control logic. The lessons learned in this project directly informed later work on
        more advanced robotic systems and autonomous platforms.
