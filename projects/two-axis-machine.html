<h1>2-Axis Machine, Realtime Control</h1>

<img class="hero" src="../Assets/projects/two-axis-machine/two-axis-machine.png" alt="2 Axis Machine Platform">

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Implemented and controled a 2-axis electromechanical motion system as part of a laboratory-based controls and mechatronics course.
The project focused on low-level embedded control (C), hardware-software integration, and real-time system behaviour.
</p>

<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<img src="../Assets/projects/two-axis-machine/system-arch.jpg" alt="2-axis architecture diagram">
<ul>
    <li>Nucleo F401RE MCU - STM32</li>
    <li>Nucleo IHM02A1 servo motor driver shield</li>
    <li>UART protocol for deterministic communication</li>
</ul>

<p>
The system consists of two independently driven axes controlled by an STM32 MCU. Each axis is actuated by a servo motor and monitored
using analog sensor feedback. Motion commands and system state are communicated over a UART serial interface, enabling structured
command-based control and debugging.
</p>

<h2>Technical Contributions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Developed embedded firmware on STM32 for real-time motor control</li>
    <li>Implemented UART serial communication for command incput and system monitoring</li>
    <li>Integrated analog interfacing for sensor feedback and signal conditioning</li>
    <li>Tuned control behaviour to achieve smooth, repeatable 2-axis motion</li>
    <li>Debugged timing, noise, and scaling issues common in mixed analog/digital systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tight polling vs. HW Interrupt Latency Analysis</h2>
<p>
Using lab scopes, tight polling and interrup algorithms were analyzed in their speed & latency - along with max MCU clock speed
each approach would not fail under (found to be ~1.3MHz).
</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tight Polling -> Variance: 336ns w/persistence of 100ms</li>

    <li>Interrupts -> Variance: 220ns - 450ns w/persistence of 100ms </li>
